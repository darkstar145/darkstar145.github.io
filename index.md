My name is Stefan Peng. I am currently a senior in Computer Engineering at Iowa State University with minors in Chinese and Chemistry. I enjoy working on projects as a team player as well as working independently. I have demonstrated experience in taking a project from the requirements phase through to a final product using a variety of tools and technologies. I also have a strong background in chemistry and biology. I am conducting research in the Sakaguchi Lab to better understand stem cells and their applications.

Career objective: my goal is to work in a technical capacity for some time before transitioning to a management role. I believe my strong interpersonal and communication skills, in addition to my broad education and experience, will make me an effective leader.

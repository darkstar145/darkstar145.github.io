For my final project in CPR E 288: Embedded Systems, I worked with a team of 3 other students to program a remotely operated robot. The goal was to use sensor data from the robot to guide the robot through an obstacle course. Each student contributed portions of the code running on the robot (reading sensor data, sending commands to the motors, and so on). My specific role was to create the remote control interface in Matlab. This application allowed us to see the sensor data from the robot and send commands back to the robot. Over the course of the project, I learned about programming embedded systems as well as creating graphical user interfaces in Matlab.

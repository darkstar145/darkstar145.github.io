For COM S 309: Software Development Practices, I worked with a team of 3 other students to create a cross-platform messaging application. Our final product allowed users to send text, images, and links between Android, iOS, and web clients. My role was to create the iOS and web clients, both of which were new to me at the time. This meant that I had to learn iOS and React programming from scratch. I also had to learn about Google's Firebase platform, which was what we used to connect our different clients. To get up to speed quickly on all the new technologies I was using, I leveraged existing documentation and tutorials. The end result was a functioning, cross-platform messaging solution that I wrote two clients for.

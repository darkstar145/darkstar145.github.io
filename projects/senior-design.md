My senior design project's goal is to create a tool, CySec, to model network security using game theory. This will allow network administrators to determine weaknesses in their networks and help them allocate resources to improve network security.

I am the research lead for the project, which means that I am responsible for learning about game theory and how existing solutions can inform the design of our tool. I am also part of the backend team, where I help write the code that processes the network models and performs game theory optimization to identify threat pathways and suggest investment opportunities.

From a theoretical side, I have learned about different ways to analyze network security, including attack trees, attack-defense trees, and game-theoretic models. From a technical side, I have learned how the use the Django python framework and interface with external libraries like `Nash.py`, which is a game theory library for Python.
